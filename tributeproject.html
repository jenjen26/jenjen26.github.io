        Hosts and Judges
        </h3>
        <p class="article-paragraph">
           Over the years that the show has been on air there have been some changes to both the hosts and judges. During the first six seasons, the two judges were Mary Berry and Paul Hollywood with hosts Sue Perkins and Mel Giedroyc. For the following seasons, the two judges were Paul Hollywood and Prue Leith with cohosts Noel Fielding and Sandi Toksvig.

        The Challenges
        </h3>
        <div class="challenges">
        <p> 
          <strong>The Signature Challenge:</strong> the contestants make a recipe they have practiced at home prior to the challenge. It's up to the contestant to choose the recipe - whether it's a family favorite or a traditional classic. The judges taste the creations and provide feedback. 
        </p>
        
        <p>
          <strong>  The Technical Challenge: </strong> the contestants are provided a pared down recipe of a unique baked good and are expected to bake the target item to perfection using their prior knowledge and skill. This baked good is usually obscure and most contestants are unfamiliar with the final product or have never made it before. At the end of the challenge, they place their item at the judging table and it is blindly ranked from best to worst. 
        </p>
        
        <p>
          <strong>  The Showstopper Challenge: </strong> the contestants now blend their creativity and skill to create a more elaborate dessert that fulfills the brief. The judges taste the creations and provide feedback if they fulfilled the brief successfully.
